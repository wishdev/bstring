Better String library
---------------------

by Paul Hsieh

The bstring library is an attempt to provide improved string processing
functionality to the C and C++ language.  At the heart of the bstring library
(Bstrlib for short) is the management of "bstring"s which are a significant
improvement over '\0' terminated char buffers.
